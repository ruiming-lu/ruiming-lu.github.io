I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Professor [Guangtao Xue](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~xue-gt/) and Professor [Minglu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cFW1n8YAAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from the [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). Here is my [[CV](https://ruiming-lu.github.io/files/cv.pdf)].

My current research focuses on the reliability aspect of modern data centers. I work towards analyzing the failure characteristics of massively-deployed storage devices (e.g., NVMe SSD), understanding novel failure modes (e.g., the fail-slow failure), and designing practical fault-tolerant systems.
